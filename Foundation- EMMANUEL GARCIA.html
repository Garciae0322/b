                <h3>About Myself</h3>
                <p>My name is Emmanuel Garcia, i am a 21 year old who wants to become an software and web developer. Growing up, i had plenty of different things i wanted to overcome in life, but when i started getting older, my mind changed a lot. I'm from East Harlem/El Barrio, coming from Wagner Projects in NYCHA Development. I believe the "New York Code & Design Academy" will help me over come my dreams of getting my skills and experience as a developer started. At NYCDA, i believe i can push my skills to an better level of experience i use to have and to create projects by learning other programming languages. I started self teaching myself how to code on <a href="Codeacademy.com">CodeacademyPro</a> version. I gotten my diploma in 2016 and started 1 year of college but sad to say i couldnt afford to pay the rest off so i was really trying to learn computer science with a bootcamp. I live in a house hold of 6, which includes, me, mother, 3 little brothers & my baby sister. Yes i am the oldest sibling. I am doing my best to represent myself as a young man to my family within the household.</p>
